* Org GTD Email
this script is used to convert my task managed by org mode to gmail compatible html.
since my boss dislike me to send picture instead of text.

** Why not use org export to html
I dislike it's style, need external css, but gmail don't support it.
And it will auto add num in each headline, which I don't find a way to change 
this behavior.

** How to use
#+begin_src python 
pip install -r requirements.txt
./main.py --input {org source} --output {html}
#+end_src

then you can open the html by firefox or chrome and copy content to gmail input box.

** Exmaple
check the exmaple.org and example.html
